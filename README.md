<img src ="https://github.com/julien-duponchelle/python-mysql-replication/blob/main/logo.svg">
Pure Python Implementation of MySQL replication protocol build on top of PyMYSQL. This allows you to receive event like insert, update, delete with their datas and raw SQL queries.

# Use cases

- MySQL to NoSQL database replication
- MySQL to search engine replication
- Invalidate cache when something change in database
- Audit
- Real time analytics

# Documentation

A work in progress documentation is available here: https://python-mysql-replication.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Instruction about building documentation is available here:
https://python-mysql-replication.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developement.html

# Installation

```
pip install mysql-replication
```

# Getting support

You can get support and discuss about new features on:
https://github.com/julien-duponchelle/python-mysql-replication/discussions

# Project status

The project is test with:

- MySQL 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7 (v0.1 ~ v0.45)
- MySQL 8.0.14 (v1.0 ~)
- MariaDB 10.6
- Python 3.9, 3.13
- PyPy 3.7, 3.9 (really faster than the standard Python interpreter)

MySQL version 8.0.14 and later Set global variable binlog_row_metadata='FULL' and binlog_row_image='FULL'

The project is used in production for critical stuff in some
medium internet corporations. But all use case as not
been perfectly test in the real world.

# MySQL server settings

In your MySQL server configuration file you need to enable replication:

    [mysqld]
    server-id		           = 1
    log_bin			           = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
    binlog_expire_logs_seconds = 864000
    max_binlog_size            = 100M
    binlog-format              = ROW #Very important if you want to receive write, update and delete row events
    binlog_row_metadata        = FULL
    binlog_row_image           = FULL

reference: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html

# Examples

All examples are available in the [examples directory](https://github.com/noplay/python-mysql-replication/tree/main/examples)

This example will dump all replication events to the console:

```python
from pymysqlreplication import BinLogStreamReader

mysql_settings = {'host': '127.0.0.1', 'port': 3306, 'user': 'root', 'passwd': ''}

stream = BinLogStreamReader(connection_settings = mysql_settings, server_id=100)

for binlogevent in stream:
    binlogevent.dump()

stream.close()
```

For this SQL sessions:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE test;
use test;
CREATE TABLE test4 (id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, data VARCHAR(255), data2 VARCHAR(255), PRIMARY KEY(id));
INSERT INTO test4 (data,data2) VALUES ("Hello", "World");
UPDATE test4 SET data = "World", data2="Hello" WHERE id = 1;
DELETE FROM test4 WHERE id = 1;
```

Output will be:
