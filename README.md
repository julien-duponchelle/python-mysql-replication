<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysql-replication"><img src="http://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/mysql-replication.svg"></a>

Pure Python Implementation of MySQL replication protocol build on top of PyMYSQL. This allow you to receive event like insert, update, delete with their datas and raw SQL queries.

Use cases
===========

* MySQL to NoSQL database replication
* MySQL to search engine replication
* Invalidate cache when something change in database
* Audit
* Real time analytics

Documentation
==============

A work in progress documentation is available here: https://python-mysql-replication.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Instruction about building documentation is available here:
https://python-mysql-replication.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developement.html


Installation
=============

```
pip install mysql-replication
```

Mailing List
==============

You can get support and discuss about new features on:
https://groups.google.com/d/forum/python-mysql-replication



Project status
================

The project is test with:
* MySQL 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7
* Python 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 (3.2 is not supported)
* PyPy (really faster than the standard Python interpreter)

The project is used in production for critical stuff in some
medium internet corporations. But all use case as not
been perfectly test in the real world.

Limitations

MySQL server settings
=========================

In your MySQL server configuration file you need to enable replication:

    [mysqld]
    server-id		 = 1
    log_bin			 = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
    expire_logs_days = 10
    max_binlog_size  = 100M
    binlog-format    = row #Very important if you want to receive write, update and delete row events

Examples
=========

All examples are available in the [examples directory](https://github.com/noplay/python-mysql-replication/tree/master/examples)


This example will dump all replication events to the console:

```python
from pymysqlreplication import BinLogStreamReader

mysql_settings = {'host': '127.0.0.1', 'port': 3306, 'user': 'root', 'passwd': ''}

stream = BinLogStreamReader(connection_settings = mysql_settings, server_id=100)

for binlogevent in stream:
    binlogevent.dump()

stream.close()
```

For this SQL sessions:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE test;
use test;
CREATE TABLE test4 (id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, data VARCHAR(255), data2 VARCHAR(255), PRIMARY KEY(id));
INSERT INTO test4 (data,data2) VALUES ("Hello", "World");
UPDATE test4 SET data = "World", data2="Hello" WHERE id = 1;
DELETE FROM test4 WHERE id = 1;
```

Output will be:
